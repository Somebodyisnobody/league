This is the league server code for a Clonk league. It was initially
written for the clonk.de titles and later adopted for OpenClonk.

Prequisites
===========
To run the league, you need:
-A webserver that runs PHP. Don't know which version; but 5.5.3 seems to
 work
-A MySQL database
 If you want to try it out locally: XAMPP worked fine for me out of the
 box on a Windows machine (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).

-The smarty template engine: http://www.smarty.net/. Tested under 3.1.14



Installation
============
1. Extract the league code somewhere into your web root. 

2. Create a database for the league (if possible). If you need, you can
   probably also use a shared database. All league tables are prefixed
   by "lg_".

3. Enter values into config.php:
3.1  $webroot should point to the folder where the league code (i.e.,
     the config.php you are editing) is; including the trailing slash.
3.2  Update the require_once('smarty/libs/SmartyBC.class.php');
     statement to point to where you put the smarty library.
3.3  Insert database credentials into the line that says
     "$database = & new database[...]"
3.4  Update the $debug-statements to your liking if you want to enable
     some SQL debugging information.

4. Set up the league schema. Just execute the file "table_structure.sql"
   on your league database (using phpmysqladmin via your web broweser or
   the direct mysql interface).

5. Create an admin user; e.g. using the following SQL statement (creates
   a user named "admin" with password "password"):
INSERT INTO `lg_users` (`id`, `name`, `password`, `admin`, `operator`)
VALUES (1, 'admin', MD5('password'), 1, '');

6. Grant admin permissions to your newly created user using the
   following SQL statement:
INSERT INTO `lg_admin_permissions` (`user_id`, `part`, `method`) VALUES
(1, 'clan', ''), (1, 'cuid_ban', ''), (1, 'debug', ''), (1, 'game', ''),
(1, 'league', ''), (1, 'log', ''), (1, 'resource', ''),
(1, 'scenario', ''), (1, 'test', ''), (1, 'user', '');

7. Register default languages (English, German) using the following SQL
   statement:
INSERT INTO `lg_languages` (`id`, `code`, `name`, `flag`) VALUES
(1, 'en', 'English', 'images/icons/flag_en.gif'),
(2, 'de', 'Deutsch', 'images/icons/flag_de.gif');

8. Register a game engine (e.g.: OpenClonk) using the following SQL
   statement:
INSERT INTO `lg_products`
(`id`, `name`, `icon`, `version`, `product_string`, `motd_sid`)
VALUES (1, 'OpenClonk', 'oc.png', '5.0.0', 'OC', 0);

9. Update some game engine strings and icons in lang/strings_de.php and
   lang/strings_en.php. E.g. for OpenClonk:
$this->strings['filter_OpenClonk'] = "OpenClonk";
$this->strings['filter_icon_OpenClonk_on'] = "oc_icon_32.png";
$this->strings['filter_icon_OpenClonk_off'] = "oc_icon_32_off.png";

10. Make sure unnecessery files aren't left on the web root:
   table_structure.sql, table_structure_alter.sql,
   table_structure_updates.txt. Delete them if you're done
   installing/updating.

11. Now you should be able to browse to your league, log in, press
    "Admin" and set up a league using the builtin admin interface.
